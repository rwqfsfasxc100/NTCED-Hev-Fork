NTCED_DESCRIPTION|Expands the selection of nanodrone launchers available at Enceladus's shipyards.

SYSTEM_DND_DHMOD|NTCED Dual Haulers M.O.D.

SYSTEM_DND_DHMOD_DESC|A modified verison of Minding LF's Hual drones, this has the same range as the standard MLF Drone but allowing two drones to be launched simultaneously at the cost of higher power draw. Very popular with Titan class ships as it allowed for longer mining expeditions.

SYSTEM_DND_DHMOD_SPECS|Power draw: 80 MW \nEffective range: 400 m (line of sight) \nBuilt-in Storage: 500 kg \nDrone launch capability: 55 dps \nDrone Amount: 2 Drones \nMass: 8,000 kg \nManufacturer: Nishikawa Technologies Corporate Engineering Division

SYSTEM_DND_DHMOD_MANUAL|Moves ore and lifepods automatically towards cargo hold. \nOre targeting criteria can be adjusted on the Geologist tab. \nCan interface with compatible reconnaissance craft. \nRequires nanodrone components storage. \nManeuvers during operation will cause the system to attempt to adjust movement of all valid targets.


SYSTEM_DND_EHCDrone|NTCED Extended Harvester Class

SYSTEM_DND_EHCDrone_DESC|One of the first equipment offerings from Nishikawa Technologies Corporate Engineering Division, it expands on Minding LF's Haul drones, used on small class stations to extend sustuinable within the Rings.

SYSTEM_DND_EHCDrone_SPECS|Power draw: 55 MW \nEffective range: 600 m (line of sight) \nBuilt-in Storage: 1,000 kg \nDrone launch capability: 65 dps \nMass: 3,500 kg \nManufacturer: Nishikawa Technologies Corporate Engineering Division

SYSTEM_DND_EHCDrone_MANUAL|Moves ore and lifepods automatically towards cargo hold. \nOre targeting criteria can be adjusted on the Geologist tab. \nCan interface with compatible reconnaissance craft. \nRequires nanodrone components storage. \nManeuvers during operation will cause the system to attempt to adjust movement of all valid targets.



SYSTEM_DND_XLEHCDrone|NTCED XLE Harvester Class

SYSTEM_DND_XLEHCDrone_DESC|After 2 years after it's initial offering, the XLE model offers extended range from it's previous model, allowing for greater flexibly and safety while mining larger asteroids.

SYSTEM_DND_XLEHCDrone_SPECS|Power draw: 70 MW \nEffective range: 800 m (line of sight) \nBuilt-in Storage: 1,750 kg \nDrone launch capability: 75 dps \nMass: 4,350 kg \nManufacturer: Nishikawa Technologies Corporate Engineering Division

SYSTEM_DND_XLEHCDrone_MANUAL|Moves ore and lifepods automatically towards cargo hold. \nOre targeting criteria can be adjusted on the Geologist tab. \nCan interface with compatible reconnaissance craft. \nRequires nanodrone components storage. \nManeuvers during operation will cause the system to attempt to adjust movement of all valid targets.


SYSTEM_DND_DHHC|NTCED Dual Hybird Harvester Class

SYSTEM_DND_DHHC_DESC|This model is the most exclusive and premium offering from NTCED, the hybird harvester class combines the XLE model and it's first tinkerings with dual drones launchers into a very formidable class of its own. While on the pricer side of things, the model only increases by a 5 MW difference while having extended ranges of 950 meters, allowing stations and mining ships alike to sustain themsevles for months on end within Saturn's rings.

SYSTEM_DND_DHHC_SPECS|Power draw: 85 MW \nEffective range: 950 m (line of sight) \nBuilt-in Storage: 3,500 kg \nDrone launch capability: 80 dps \nDrone Amount: 2 Drones \nMass: 6,000 kg \nManufacturer: Nishikawa Technologies Corporate Engineering Division

SYSTEM_DND_DHHC_MANUAL|Moves ore and lifepods automatically towards cargo hold. \nOre targeting criteria can be adjusted on the Geologist tab. \nCan interface with compatible reconnaissance craft. \nRequires nanodrone components storage. \nManeuvers during operation will cause the system to attempt to adjust movement of all valid targets.


SYSTEM_DND_PMDrone|NTCED Protype MIL-SPEC Miner Class

SYSTEM_DND_PMDrone_DESC|A leaked protype model meant for the military back on Earth for it's mining ships, it offers a much more extensive range than the consumer models from NTCED.

SYSTEM_DND_PMDrone_SPECS|Power draw: 115 MW \nEffective range: 1000 m (line of sight) \nBuilt-in Storage: 5,000 kg \nDrone launch capability: 100 dps \nMass: 2,375 kg \nManufacturer: Nishikawa Technologies Corporate Engineering Division

SYSTEM_DND_PMDrone_MANUAL|Moves ore and lifepods automatically towards cargo hold. \nOre targeting criteria can be adjusted on the Geologist tab. \nCan interface with compatible reconnaissance craft. \nRequires nanodrone components storage. \nManeuvers during operation will cause the system to attempt to adjust movement of all valid targets.


SYSTEM_DND_PEXTMDrone|NTCED Protype EXT MIL-SPEC Miner Class

SYSTEM_DND_PEXTMDrone_DESC|Another leaked protype model meant for Titan class mining ships that were aimed for deep space exploration. It's a highly unrefined model so it has a very high power draw and very wasteful in its drone use though the pros outweigh the cons with its capabilities.

SYSTEM_DND_PEXTMDrone_SPECS|Power draw: 225 MW \nEffective range: 1200 m (line of sight) \nBuilt-in Storage: 10,000 kg \nDrone launch capability: 275 dps \n Mass: 5,500 kg \nManufacturer: Nishikawa Technologies Corporate Engineering Division

SYSTEM_DND_PEXTMDrone_MANUAL|Moves ore and lifepods automatically towards cargo hold. \nOre targeting criteria can be adjusted on the Geologist tab. \nCan interface with compatible reconnaissance craft. \nRequires nanodrone components storage. \nManeuvers during operation will cause the system to attempt to adjust movement of all valid targets.
